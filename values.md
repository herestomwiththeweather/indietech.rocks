What are products that don't screw us, their users? We think it boils down to three things:

1. **We have control over our data.** We can have access to all of it. We can move it
   somewhere else and take it away from a vendor who has lost our trust. We can delete it
   if we so like. We can do all sorts of things with it, only limited by our imagination.

2. **We have options.** It means no lock-in. It means we can stop our relationship with
   the vendor, and go somewhere else, without substantial loss. For example, open-source
   in inherently forkable, so an open-source project cannot really lock us in. But even
   if a product is not open-source, it might still not lock us in.

3. **Nothing happens behind our backs that we don't know about or cannot prevent.** For
   example, no selling of our data, our click stream, or behaviors, even in aggregate.
   Unless we specifically consent and can revoke that consent at any time.
