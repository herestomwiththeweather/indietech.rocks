At [Indie Web Summit 2017](https://2017.indieweb.org/), a group of attendees decided to create
this site. Here are some notes in case you are interested: [indieweb.org/2017/Demos](https://indieweb.org/2017/Demos)

Indietech.rocks is provided as a service to the community. If you know of products that incorporate
these [values](values), please do tell us so we can add them. Ideally, you fork repository
[indietech.rocks](https://github.com/indietechrocks/indietech.rocks) on Github, and submit
a pull request. If you don't know what this means, tweet to us at
{% include icon-twitter.html username="indietechrocks" %}.
