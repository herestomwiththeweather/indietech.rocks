Remember bookmarking site del.icio.us? Shaarli is just like it, except that it
will not be put under new management over and over, as it happened with del.icio.us.
That's because it is an open-source, server-side application that you control.

Go to the <a href="/products/#Shaarli">Shaarli</a> listing.
