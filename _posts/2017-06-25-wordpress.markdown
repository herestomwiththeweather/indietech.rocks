**Indie Web Summit in Portland, OR, June 25, 2017**: They claim it
powers 28% of the internet. It has more than 50,000 types of plugins.
And their business model is very straightforward: download the code,
and do whatever you like with it (as long as you keep sharing according
to the terms of the GPL), or give us some money (or accept ads) and
we will host it for you.

Arguably Wordpress is so popular precisely because nobody gets screwed.

Of course, Wordpress needs to be on our list, both the
open-source server-side install-yourself version, and the hosted
service.
