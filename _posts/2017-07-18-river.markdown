You can choose your friends on Facebook and Twitter. But that does not mean these
companies will send you all of their posts. They select, and they won't even tell
you how they pick what they show you and what not. That's of course because they
do not practice the <a href="/values/">values</a> of IndieTech.rocks, which put you
in control. They value their advertising dollars more than you.

What can we do about that? Simple: use RSS and an RSS Reader, such as
River5 from RSS godfather <a href="http://davewiner.com/">Dave Winer</a>.
Not only does it put you in control which news you see, and which you don't,
but it's also open-source, so there is no lock-in. And because River runs on
a server, it's harder to track you across the web, and thus more privacy-protecting
for your news habits as well.
