Ever come across an interesting, but long, article on the web that you'd
love to read, but don't have time for right now? Enter Wallabag, which
lets you easily bookmark this article. But unlike just bookmarking, Wallabag
stores the entire article, so you can come back to it any time later and it
will still be there for you to enjoy.

Wallabag exists both as a hosted service, and as a self-hostable server-side
app.

Go to the <a href="/products/#Wallabag">Wallabag</a> listing.
