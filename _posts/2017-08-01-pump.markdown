From the <a href="http://pump.io/">website</a>:

<blockquote>
<p>I post something and my followers see it. That's the rough idea behind the pump.</p>

<p>You can post almost anything that can be represented with activity streams --
short or long text, bookmarks, images, video, audio, events, geo checkins.
You can follow friends, create lists of people, and so on.</p>

<p>The software is useful for at least these scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mobile-first social networking</li>
<li>Activity stream functionality for an existing app</li>
<li>Experimenting with social software</li>
</ul>

<p>It also comes with a web UI.</p>
