webtrees is the web's leading on-line collaborative genealogy application. It is
open source software, and costs $ zero - yes, that means totally FREE!

All you need to use it is a website with PHP and MySQL installed.

It works from standard GEDCOM files, and is therefore compatible with every
major desktop application; and it aims to be efficient and effective by using
the right combination of third-party tools, design techniques and open standards
(from the <a href="https://www.webtrees.org/">webtrees.org</a> site).
