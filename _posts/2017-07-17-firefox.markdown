Here is what Firefox <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">says
about itself:

**The 100% fresh, free-range, ethical browser**

*More speed*

Bring it, Internet! We've spent the last year supercharging Firefox's
performance. Now start up faster, tab hop quicker and scroll like a speed demon. 
*More privacy*

Firefox doesn't sell access to your personal information like other companies.
From privacy tools to tracking protection, you're in charge of who sees what. 

*More freedom*

Following the pack isn't our style. As part of the non-profit Mozilla,
Firefox leads the fight to protect your online rights and champion an
Internet that benefits everyone â€” not just a few.
