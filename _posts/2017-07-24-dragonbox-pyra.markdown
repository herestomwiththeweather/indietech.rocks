You will not find as many ports on other mobile systems.

These days, mobile devices only offer one, maybe two ports.
The Pyra is different.

It features one USB 3.0 OTG port, two full-sized USB 2.0 ports
(one has additional SATA output, available via an adapter),
one Micro-USB Serial Output-Port (which can also be used to
charge the system), a headset port (that supports ALL TRRS
standards) and a MicroHDMI port.

You can easily connect a mouse, keyboard and monitor without
any additional hardware and use it as a desktop PC!
