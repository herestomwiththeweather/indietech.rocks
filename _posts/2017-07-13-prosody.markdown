Texting and chatting on-line are all nice and good, but how come it
requires some kind of Big Brother company like Facebook or Google so
we can chat with our friends? 

Well, it doesn't. Prosody is a modern XMPP server, which means it
lets you chat with your friends, using widely available XMPP client
software, without Big Brother, and without anybody listening but you.
