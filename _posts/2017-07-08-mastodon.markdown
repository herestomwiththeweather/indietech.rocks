Wouldn't social media be great if the social media sites didn't all track your every move,
sell out your data to the highest bidder, and bombard you with ads? There are alternatives,
such as Mastodon.

Based on the open GNU Social protocol, you can set up your own instance of Mastodon for
your friends and family, and still connect with anybody else, even if they are not using
your website. And if you are used to Twitter, you will feel right at home.

Go to the <a href="/products/#Mastodon">Mastodon</a> listing.
