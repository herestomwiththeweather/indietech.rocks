Even Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of the world's most dominant (and centralized) social network,
Facebook, supposedly donated to it. Diaspora* burst on the scene with the goal to 
make social networking possible without somebody like Mark Zuckerberg in the middle.
And it works.

The link on the product page on this site leads to the sign-up page on a random Diaspora*
installation, you can find dozens of high-quality Diaspora* installations to choose from
<a href="https://podupti.me/">here</a>. Of course, nothing is preventing you from
running your own installation either.

Go to the <a href="/products/#Diaspora">Diaspora*</a> listing.
