Created by the inventor of the Wiki, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham">Ward Cunningham</a>
 and his collaborators, Federated Wiki is quite unlike anything you might ever have seen.
 Unlike centralized wikis such
 as <a href="https://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, Federated Wiki creates a seamless wiki experience
 from content provided by lots of people, each of whom run their own wiki server. This enables
 unparalleled, uninhibited decentralized collaboration.

As the code is available as open source, you can set up your own instance and start collaborating
 with Ward and others across the internet.
