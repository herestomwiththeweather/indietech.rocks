Dave Winer has created a number of outliners over the years, starting with More many years ago.
Little Outliner is his latest version. It runs entirely in a web browser and stores
your outlines on a server that he operates. It's very easy and straightforward to use.

Little Outliner is somewhat unusual in our list of products that don't screw you,
because it is technically not open source. However, it does not have to be
as it stores outlines in OMPL, an open data format for outlines (also pioneered by
Dave), so there is no lock-in.
