DuckDuckGo (DDG) is an Internet search engine that emphasizes protecting searchers' privacy and avoiding
 the filter bubble of personalized search results.[3] DuckDuckGo distinguishes itself from other
 search engines by not profiling its users and by deliberately showing all users the same search
 results for a given search term. (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo">Wikipedia</a>)
