Smart thermostats like the Nest thermostat are cool, but most of them collect
lots of data about us and our families and ship it off to the vendor.
Who then is not even clear just what all the things are they do with it.

Enter HestiaPi, an "Open Smart thermostat without the personal data 
harvesting". It is completely open-source -- both hardware and software --
and built using the Raspberry Pi.
