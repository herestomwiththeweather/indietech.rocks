Yesterday, we added the <a href="/product/#Riot">Riot</a> app that
enables secure chat, voice and video over the decentralized Matrix
protocol. Today, it's time we added the Synapse server, which is
the canonical Matrix server implementation.

Go to the <a href="/products/#Synapse">Synapse</a> listing.
