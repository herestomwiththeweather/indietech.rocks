The project was started around 2003.
Kdenlive is built on Qt and the KDE Frameworks libraries. Most of the video
processing is done by the MLT Framework, which relies on many other open source
projects like FFmpeg, frei0r, movit, ladspa, sox, etcâ€¦

Kdenlive was designed to answer most needs, from basic video editing to
professional work. It is developed by a small team and new contributors are welcome.
